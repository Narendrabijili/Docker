Docker:

Docker is a containerization tool that packages an application along with all its dependencies into a container, so it runs the same in every environment.
We use Docker to avoid environment issues, make application setup easier, and deploy applications faster.
                          OR.
Docker is a containerization platform that uses OS-level virtualization to run applications in isolated containers.
It helps ensure environment consistency, improves deployment speed, optimizes resource usage compared to virtual machines, and is commonly used in CI/CD pipelines and microservices architectures.

Note: 
Unlike virtual machines, Docker containers are lightweight, start faster, and share the host OS, making them more efficient.
The main purpose of Docker is to ensure that the application runs the same across different environments like development, testing, and production. This helps avoid common issues such as “it works on my machine.

Image vs Container:

In docker there are docker container and docker image 

In Docker, an image is a blueprint and a container is a running instance of that image.
A Docker image contains the application code, libraries, dependencies, and configuration. It is read-only and used to create containers.
A Docker container is created from an image and represents the running application. Containers are lightweight, isolated, and can be started, stopped, or deleted easily.
Multiple containers can be created from the same image.

Image: Template / blueprint
Container: Running application

After installing docker in server the user we need to add in docker group.

# sudo usermod -aG docker username -- adding user to docker group after adding user refresh the server

we can creat CA (container) after downloading/pulling the images .it pull images from central registery docker hub.same as repoes.

#docker pull images: we can give versions or if we can give anything then it'll pull latest thinmg.

#docker create CA.
#docker ps -a -- it shows all CA including status of all CA
#docker start CA-ID

#docker rm or rm -f CA-ID -- To remove or delete CA
#docker rmi image         -- To delete CA images
#docker ps -a -q          -- it'll show all CA-ID'
#docker rm -f  'docker ps -a -q' -- To delete all CA vth help CA-ID'S

#docker run -d image --insteaded of pull image + creating starting + starting CA sepertly by using run in one  command it do all 3 steps and -d indictes the if we run only run means the process will run in fore gorund nothing but it will see in the terminal it take time so if we give -d means we are sending to backend to run this we called detach mode 0r detach the screen.

In every server there are 65535 ports and same CA also has same ports .server ports we call host ports and CA ports.host ports we can not reuseable and CA ports are fixed to particular service or images.

#docker -d -p 8080(host port):80(CA port) --name CA-NAME image --To give name for CA vthout defalut name.we can't create duplicate CA names

#docker exec -it CA-NAME bash --- To go into CA or login to CA
    exec --excute
    -it -- interactive terminal

#docker inspect CA-NAME -- To know the CA info like ip,ports,versions etc

#docker logs CA-NAME -- to check latest logs of CA if we need to check all logs we need to login to CA and then we need to check

Commands:

docker pull imagename
docker create CA
docker start CA-ID
docker ps or docker ps -a -q - it shows all CS-ID'S and status
docker rm -f CA-ID -- to delete CA
docker rmi image -- to delete docker image.
docker run -d image -- it directly downlode image and create CA and will start it.
